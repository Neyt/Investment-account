# The 50% Buffett Challenge
I have done only done 3 interviews in my life for publications... as far as I can remember. 

The last one was made to me on 2019 - 9 -19.

https://yfsmagazine.com/2019/09/19/can-investors-beat-warren-buffetts-50-per-year-return-in-the-stock-market/

Here I mentioned that I was expecting the end to the 13-year bull market. 

And also started the "50% a Year Challenge” based on Warren Buffett's quote that went something among the lines of “If I had $10,000 to invest... It is a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money. I think I could make you 50% a year on $1 million. No, I know I could. I guarantee that". 

I spent almost 10 years studying Warren Buffett Strategies. I also beat the challenge with over 56.91% return closing the 2020 - 6- 9. today 2 days later. I'm seating in cash today.

Ready to close the account. Remember I only created this account for the Challenge. 



here are the screenshots of the results:

Here is the screenshot of the account (just as described in the interview 9 months ago, same number)



Rate of return on the last account overview: 56.91% Year to date


Here you can see different benchmarks to compare since inception
SPXTR 14.14%
EFA 2.49%
VT 8.84%
ME 54.67%



Here is the benchmark comparison



And this is the one that I like the best: 
These returns were achieved with less risk than the market



I may do a podcast episode on FinanciallyFreePodcast.com there are very cool interviews. 
But the summary of this returns is basically
If you do not find value, or you are not certain of what you invest the stay in cash as long as you need... But put the work everyday
Focus!
The reason I could get these returns, and anyone for that matter, is because of focus. 
The reality is that I was expecting for this returns to take longer because I was looking for dark companies that no one else is paying attention to like the interview I posted 2 days ago with Dan Schum here https://financiallyfreepodcast.libsyn.com/24-514-per-year-for-7-years-with-dan-schum
But the matter of fact is when the covid19 crash came I had to change strategy completely.

3. Which bring me to the last lesson: don't box yourself to be a "value investor" a "trader", an "option trader" (check my podcast we talk about all of this subjects), be a MAKE MONEY INVESTOR. Those are all tools, different mindsets, do what make sense.
